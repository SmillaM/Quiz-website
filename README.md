1. To ensure that the user can only enter letters in the first name and surname fields, and the correct format for email, I declared a Regex variable. I found a template for this online. 
To show error messages I added <span> under each input field to make them appear later with JavaScript.
I wanted the error message to appear next to the label, so I hade to rearrange the order in the HTML code.
